## **Description**
<a id="description"></a>
This website is a personal website I have created as my final project for my Web Development I class at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg, New Jersey. As part of each week's assignment, I have added the following content to the site:

### Adding HTML, Images and Links
  - Here, I learned how to create a new HTML document, the file structure of a web page and some helpful shortcuts in VS code, such as the Emmet shortcuts to generate basic HTML boilerplate code, which I use any time I create a new webpage. I also learned how to add images to a webpage, including an avatar and a stand-in for a logo I would create later in the course.
<br>

### Initial Setup on Github and Netlify
  - I learned how to use essential features of Github such as editing my profile, creating repositories and setting up Git in VS Code. I also learned how to host a site on Netlify from a Github repository. 
<br>

### Adding Some Style
  - During this assignment, I learned the basics of CSS, and I was able to practice by adding colors, fonts, text and box styling. 
<br>

### Tell Me More
  - Here, I added a hobbies section, a photo gallery to the page. 
    - In the **Hobbies** section, I mostly focused on experimenting with some more advanced CSS parameters such as gradients, box shadows and link hover effects. 
    - In the **Gallery** section, I learned how to properly size and align images, and I was able to make the gallery somewhat responsive with some simple box model-related CSS properties. 
    - In the **Article** section, I learned how to create an article with text wrapping, as well as how to use CSS pseudo selectors to create a dropcap that modifies the first character of every paragraph. 
<br>

### Responsive Design
  - Here, I learned how to use media queries to make my webpage responsive on a tablet and a laptop or large tablet. I also was able to practice with Flexbox and Grid properties to alter the ways that several sections display based on screen size. 
<br>

### Embedded Media
  - Here, I learned how to embed a video from Youtube as well as how to resize the video frame while maintaining aspect ratio. 
<br>

### Web Forms
  - In the **Contact Form** section, I learned how to create a contact form with several different types of input, such as text, dropdowns and radio buttons. I also styled a submit button with a simple inset/outset effect on click based on the interface design principles we went over during the previous week. Additionally, I learned how to use Netlify as a simple backend for my website so that data submitted through the contact form would appear on my Netlify dashboard. 
<br>

### Nav Bar
  - Here, I learned how to create a simple navigation bar for my website, which allows users to navigate to specific sections of the page based on the section's ID. 
<br>

### The Final Project

## **Color Scheme**
<a id="colorscheme"></a>
I ended up making a lot of changes to the color scheme as I worked on the project. My initial color scheme technically passed Adobe Color's accessibility tests and looked decent enough through Chromelens in a vacuum, but in practice, I found the colors were very difficult to use together in a way that I found visually appealing, and I found myself needing to choose between style and readability too often. For the final version of my site, I chose to generate a new color palette using Adobe color with better contrast. My final color palette includes the following:
