## **Description**

<a id="description"></a>
This website is a personal website I have created as my final project for my Web Development I class at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg, New Jersey. As part of each week's assignment, I have added the following content to the site:

### **Adding HTML, Images and Links**

- Here, I learned how to create a new HTML document, the file structure of a web page and some helpful shortcuts in VS code, such as the Emmet shortcuts to generate basic HTML boilerplate code, which I use any time I create a new webpage. I also learned how to add images to a webpage, including an avatar and a stand-in for a logo I would create later in the course.

<br>

### **Initial Setup on Github and Netlify**

- I learned how to use essential features of Github such as editing my profile, creating repositories and setting up Git in VS Code. I also learned how to host a site on Netlify from a Github repository.

<br>

### **Adding Some Style**

- During this assignment, I learned the basics of CSS, and I was able to practice by adding colors, fonts, text and box styling.

<br>

### **Tell Me More**

- Here, I added a hobbies section, a photo gallery to the page. - In the **Hobbies** section, I mostly focused on experimenting with some more advanced CSS parameters such as gradients, box shadows and link hover effects.

  - In the **Gallery** section, I learned how to properly size and align images, and I was able to make the gallery somewhat responsive with some simple box model-related CSS properties.
  - Upon revisiting the **Gallery** section for the final draft of the project, I changed the static figure captions I had used initially to an image hover effect with a simple fade-in animation in order to make the section look neater and conserve screen space. I also cropped the first photo **(img\penannular-brooch-640w.jpg)** , as the original photo I had used was 640px wide, as called for in the assignment instructions, but it was taken as a portrait, meaning the aspect ratio of the photo was different. The newly cropped version has the same proportions as the other two photos in the gallery.

  - In the **Article** section, I learned how to create an article layout using text columns, as well as how to use CSS pseudo selectors to create a dropcap that modifies the first character of every paragraph.
    - For the final draft of the project, I removed the columns of text, and instead used figures and flexbox to structure the screenshots, code snippets and SVG images that I included.

<br>

### **Responsive Design**

- Here, I learned how to use media queries to make my webpage responsive on a tablet and a laptop or large tablet. I also was able to practice with Flexbox and Grid properties to alter the ways that several sections display based on screen size.

<br>

### **Embedded Media**

- Here, I learned how to embed a video from Youtube as well as how to resize the video frame while maintaining aspect ratio.

<br>

### **Web Forms**

- In the **Contact Form** section, I learned how to create a contact form with several different types of input, such as text, dropdowns and radio buttons. I also styled a submit button with a simple inset/outset effect on click based on the interface design principles we went over during the previous week. Additionally, I learned how to use Netlify as a simple backend for my website so that data submitted through the contact form would appear on my Netlify dashboard.

<br>

### **Nav Bar**

- Here, I learned how to create a simple navigation bar for my website, which allows users to navigate to specific sections of the page based on the section's ID.

## **Color Scheme**

<a id="colorscheme"></a>
I made a lot of changes to the color scheme as I worked on the project. My initial color scheme technically passed Adobe Color's accessibility tests and looked decent enough through Chromelens, but in practice, I found the colors were very difficult to use together in a way that I found visually appealing, and I found myself needing to choose between style and readability too often to be comfortable using my original color scheme for my final draft. For the final version of my site, I chose to generate a new color palette using Adobe color with better contrast. My final color palette includes the following:

**<span style="color:#DB4001"> Color 1:<span>**

- RGB: `rgb(219, 64, 1)`
- Hex: `#DB4001`

**<span style="color:#F9F5FC"> Color 2:<span>**

- RGB: `rgb(249, 245, 252)`
- Hex: `#F9F5FC`

**<span style="color:#B82929"> Color 3:<span>**

- RGB: `rgb(184, 41, 41)`
- Hex: `#B82929`

**<span style="color:#04805E"> Color 4:<span>**

- RGB: `rgb(4, 128, 94)`
- Hex: `#04805E`

**<span style="color:#8EF0BA"> Color 5:<span>**

- RGB: `rgb(142, 240, 186)`
- Hex: `#8EF0BA`
