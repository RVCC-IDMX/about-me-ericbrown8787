            <p><b>Hello!</b> My name is Eric Brown. I'm at RVCC to learn some new skills and 
                earn the Computer Support and Computer Programming certificates,
                and this is my website. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>I want to be...</b> somewhere in the woods, taking 
                pictures of mushrooms, singing songs around a fire or following some old train tracks. 
                <p><b>My passion is...</b>Building things. Fixing things. Keeping things working long
                after they should've quit. </p>
                <p><b> My favorite way to work is...</b>At a desk or a bench, surrounded by monitors
                and parts. Preferrably with noise-canceling headphones.</p>
