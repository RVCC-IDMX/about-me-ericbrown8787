        <div>
            <p><b>Hello!!!</b></p>
                <p>My name is Eric Brown. I'm at RVCC to learn some new skills and 
                earn the Computer Support and Computer Programming certificates,
                and this is my website. </p>
            </p>
            <p> <b>I want to be...</b> somewhere in the woods, taking 
                pictures of mushrooms, singing songs around a fire or following some old train tracks. 
                <p><b>My passion is...</b>Building things. Fixing things. Keeping things working long
                after they should've quit. </p>
                <p><b> My favorite way to work is...</b>At a desk or a bench, surrounded by monitors
                and parts. Preferrably with noise-canceling headphones.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Medieval Reenactment
                <p>My friends and I get together on weekends to sew, sing songs and hit each other with
                sticks(while wearing proper safety equipment, of course). You can check our parent 
                organization out at <a href="https://www.markland.org">Markland.org</a></p>
            </li>

            <li>Building Computers
                <p>I build and upgrade my daily driver desktop, and I like giving older computers that 
                might otherwise end up as E-waste a second chance. </p>
            </li>

            <li>Reading
                <p>Right now, I'm reading a lot of Jeff Vandermeer. Some of my 
                other favorite authors are China Mieville and Tamsyn Muir.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Camping
                <p>My partner and I are slowly working my way through camping in every NJ state park that 
                    allows camping. This year, we've been exploring the Pine Barrens.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Tabletop RPGs
                <p>I play Dungeons and Dragons, as well as some quick and 
                easy indie games when my regular group isn't feeling 
                up to continuing the main campaign. 
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>PC Gaming
                <p>...when I have the time, at least. You can see some of what I've been up to lately on my

        <h2>An Excerpt From Dracula, by Bram Stoker</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands 
                and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them. In the 
                cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, 
                as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied 
                and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, 
                and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began 
                to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. 
                Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at 
                me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:--</p>
            
            <p>No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!" I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:--</p>
            
            <p>But you? It is for you that I fear!" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low and unreal, and said:--</p>
            
            <p>Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on 
                her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if 
                God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying 
                round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms 
                and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--</p>
