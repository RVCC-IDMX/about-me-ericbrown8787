        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div>
            <p><b>Hello!!!</b></p>
                <p>My name is Eric Brown. I'm at RVCC to learn some new skills and 
                earn the Computer Support and Computer Programming certificates,
                and this is my website. </p>
            </p>
            <p> <b>I want to be...</b> somewhere in the woods, taking 
                pictures of mushrooms, singing songs around a fire or following some old train tracks. 
                <p><b>My passion is...</b>Building things. Fixing things. Keeping things working long
                after they should've quit. </p>
                <p><b> My favorite way to work is...</b>At a desk or a bench, surrounded by monitors
                and parts. Preferrably with noise-canceling headphones.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Medieval Reenactment
                <p>My friends and I get together on weekends to sew, sing songs and hit each other with
                sticks(while wearing proper safety equipment, of course). You can check our parent 
                organization out at <a href="https://www.markland.org">Markland.org</a></p>
            </li>

            <li>Building Computers
                <p>I build and upgrade my daily driver desktop, and I like giving older computers that 
                might otherwise end up as E-waste a second chance. </p>
            </li>

            <li>Reading
                <p>Right now, I'm reading a lot of Jeff Vandermeer. Some of my 
                other favorite authors are China Mieville and Tamsyn Muir.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Camping
                <p>My partner and I are slowly working my way through camping in every NJ state park that 
                    allows camping. This year, we've been exploring the Pine Barrens.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Tabletop RPGs
                <p>I play Dungeons and Dragons, as well as some quick and 
                easy indie games when my regular group isn't feeling 
                up to continuing the main campaign. 
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>PC Gaming
                <p>...when I have the time, at least. You can see some of what I've been up to lately on my 
                <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995348349">Steam profile</a></p>
